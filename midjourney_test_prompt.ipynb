    "Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm\n",
    "trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image\n",
    "synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.\n",
    "Diffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over\n",
    "time until it is not recognizable. From\n",
    "that point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.\n",
    "The issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential\n",
    "evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in\n",
    "the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.\n",
    "Training a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail\n",
    "preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a\n",

    "- The tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about\n",

    "- Please chat with each other in prompt-chat to figure out how to use v5.\n",
